Sound recording, processing, and classification program with a small subset of sound types: "Microwave Beep," "Smoke Alarm," "Dog Bark," and "Other." 
Using Decision tree with training data files.

"Direction Mode," using novel approach of extracting doppler shift from sound recording for microwave beep, to tell if the sound is on the same approximate plane as the user.\
User should move device up and down/side to side on direction mode.
